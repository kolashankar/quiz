## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Technical Debt
1. **Backend**: Consider adding caching layer (Redis) for better performance
2. **Mobile**: Optimize bundle size and lazy load components
3. **Web**: Implement proper error boundaries and fallback UI
4. **All**: Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Security Considerations
1. Rate limiting on API endpoints
2. Input validation and sanitization
3. CORS configuration for production
4. Secure cookie settings
5. JWT token refresh mechanism
6. SQL injection prevention (MongoDB injection)

### Performance Considerations
1. Implement pagination for large datasets
2. Add database indexing
3. Optimize image loading
4. Implement service worker for caching
5. Use CDN for static assets

### Scalability Considerations
1. Database sharding strategy
2. Horizontal scaling for backend
3. Load balancing setup
4. Caching strategy
5. Queue system for async operations
