def calculate_position_size(account_balance, risk_per_trade=0.02, confidence=0.85):
    """
    Kelly Criterion adjusted by confidence
    """
    max_risk_amount = account_balance * risk_per_trade
    
    # Adjust by confidence (more confident = larger position)
    position_multiplier = (confidence - 0.5) * 2  # 0.5-1.0 confidence → 0-1.0 multiplier
    
    position_size = max_risk_amount * position_multiplier
    
    return position_size
```

#### 3. **Stop Loss / Take Profit**
- Dynamic based on ATR (Average True Range)
- Risk:Reward ratio minimum 1:2
- Trailing stop for winning trades

#### 4. **Drawdown Protection**
- Maximum 10% daily loss limit
- Pause trading after 3 consecutive losses
- Reduce position size after losing streak

#### 5. **Market Condition Filter**
- Don't trade during extremely high volatility
- Avoid trading during major news events
- Check correlation between models (detect overfitting)

## ⚠️ REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS

### Important Disclaimers

1. **85% accuracy is EXTREMELY challenging**
   - Best hedge funds: 55-60% win rate
   - Profitable traders: 60-65% win rate
   - Our target: 85% (requires perfect execution)

2. **Market conditions vary**
   - High volatility = harder predictions
   - News events = unpredictable moves
   - Low liquidity = slippage issues

3. **Continuous improvement required**
   - Markets change, models must adapt
   - Regular retraining necessary
   - Pattern effectiveness degrades over time

4. **No guarantees**
   - Past performance ≠ future results
   - Even 85% accuracy can have losing streaks
   - Risk management is CRITICAL
